Here are key findings:

Crop Yield:

The total crop yield was 22.40K MT per HA.
Wheat was the most produced crop, followed by vegetables and rice.
Crop yield varied by region, with Victoria having the highest yield and Western Australia having the lowest.
Climate Factors:

The average temperature was 152.41Â°C.
Irrigation access was 552.48%.
Extreme weather events occurred 10 times.
Economic Impact:

The economic impact of climate change was 131 million USD.
Adaptation strategies such as drought-resistant crops and water management helped mitigate some of the negative impacts.
CO2 emissions from agriculture were 15.9K MT.
Overall, the analysis shows that climate change had a significant impact on agriculture in 2023, leading to reduced crop yields and economic losses. Adaptation strategies can help mitigate some of these impacts, but further action is needed to address the root causes of climate change.
